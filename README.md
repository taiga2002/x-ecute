# Problem: Static Content
Currently, posts on X.com are static, meaning they remain unchanged after publication and cannot adapt to different audiences or evolving contexts, such as increased engagement. We aim to develop a feature that allows posts to be dynamic, enabling a single post to fulfill multiple purposes.

# Solution: Dynamically Programmed Posts
To enable dynamic posts, we introduced integrated code blocks within the posts themselves. This feature allows users to apply programming logic that can modify posts in real-time, creating a unique experience for different viewers and over various time periods. To ensure it remains user-friendly and intuitive, we developed a straightforward programming language called X-ecute. This language is designed so that even individuals with minimal or no coding experience can easily enhance their posts.

# Motivation
We aimed to democratize the power of computer programming for all users of X by creating a simplified coding language. This language strikes a balance between being intuitive enough for anyone to experiment with enhancing their posts and being sophisticated enough to handle intricate logic. This fusion results in a feature that empowers every user to craft an experience that precisely aligns with their vision of the interaction between the poster and the reader.

Our client frontend is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS to replicate Xâ€™s feed page and facilitate user-generated interactivity. On the backend, we employ Flask, Tweepy, and Grok to handle server-side operations. The compiler, which includes a lexer and code generator, is developed in Python and integrated within the Flask app for simplicity in file management.
